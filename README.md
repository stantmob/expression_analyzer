Given a mathematical expression in infix notation, evaluate its result.

**For example:** 

3 * (2 + 5) = 21

3 * (2 + 5 * 2) = 36


**Tip:** In the usual infix notation, operators are written between the operands. In the postfix notation, the operators are written after the operands. 

**Infix:** 3 * (2 + 5)

**Postfix:** 3 2 5 + *
